## About this app
This is a trivia quiz app. Multiple choice question apps are one of the most popular types of educational apps on the App Store! For each question you should choose one answer out of three. In this app I use:
* UIKit/Storyboard.
* Model-View-Controller or MVC pattern for app development.
* Swift structures and functions with outputs.
